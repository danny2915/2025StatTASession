    "section": "2 Textbook Exercise",
    "text": "2 Textbook Exercise\n\n2.1 Question 1.4\n\nThe research question is: “Do asthmatic patients who practice the Buteyko method experience improvement in their condition?”\nThe cases are 600 adult patients aged 18–69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma.\nThe variables are whether or not the patient practiced the Buteyko method (categorical) and measures of quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction of the patients (categorical, ordinal). It may also be reasonable to treat the ratings on a scale of 0 to 10 as discrete numerical variables.\n\n\n\n2.2 Question 1.10\n\nEach row of the data matrix represents a participant in the survey.\nThere are 1,691 participants in the survey.\nThe table below lists the types of variables included in the study:\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nType\n\n\n\n\nsex\ncategorical\n\n\nage\nnumerical, continuous\n\n\nmaritalStatus\ncategorical\n\n\ngrossIncome\nordinal*\n\n\nsmoke\ncategorical\n\n\namtWeekends\nnumerical, discrete\n\n\namtWeekdays\nnumerical, discrete\n\n\n\n* Note that income is a continuous numerical variable, but in this survey, it is recorded as an ordinal variable.\n\n\n2.3 Question 1.22\n\nObservational.\n\nNo. Because the study is observational, we cannot infer causation.\n\nPossible confounders: caffeine intake and lack of sleep. Either could explain the observed association between stress and muscle cramps (e.g., students may cramp due to increased caffeine use or insufficient sleep).\n\n\n\n2.4 Question 1.34\n\nRandomized experiment. Sampling is stratified by age; treatment is assigned at random.\nTreatment: those assigned to exercise twice a week.\nControl: those instructed not to exercise.\nYes. The blocking variable is age group; randomization is carried out within each block.\nParticipants cannot realistically be blinded to whether they exercise. Blinding of outcome assessors is possible but not described. As written, the study is not blinded and could be subject to placebo/Hawthorne/observer effects.\nBecause of random assignment, a causal effect of exercise on the measured mental-health outcome can be inferred for the study participants (and, with blocking done well, within age groups). Generalization depends on how the stratified sample was obtained; if it’s a good probability sample of the target population of 18–55-year-olds, results generalize to that population. Otherwise, external validity is limited.\nPre-register outcomes, blinded-trials, ensure adequate sample size, record potential time-varying confounders.\n\n\n\n2.5 Question 1.38\n\nSimple random sampling: effective — gives every household equal probability of selection.\n\nStratified sampling: effective — neighborhoods are distinct; stratifying ensures sampling from each neighborhood.\n\nCluster sampling: not effective — sampling whole neighborhoods would miss households from some areas, and neighborhoods differ greatly.\n\nMulti-stage sampling: suffers from the same issue as (c).\n\nConvenience sampling: not effective — yields a biased sample (e.g., only nearby/similar neighborhoods; misses distant ones).\n\n\n\n2.6 Question 1.40\n\nExplanatory variable: percent of the population with a bachelor’s degree.\nResponse variable: per-capita income (in thousands).\n\nRelationship: strong positive linear association — as the bachelor’s-degree percent increases, per-capita income tends to increase. Few counties exceed 60% bachelor’s degree or $50k per-capita income.\n\nCausality: observational study; no causal claim. We can only say higher bachelor’s-degree share is associated with higher per-capita income.\n\n\n\n2.7 Question 2.12\nMedian is around 80. Because the distribution is left-skewed, the mean is expected to be slightly lower than the median.\n\n\n2.8 Question 2.22\n\nPercent identifying as conservatives\n372 / 910 ≈ 40.9%.\nPercent favoring “apply for citizenship”\n278 / 910 ≈ 30.6%.\nPercent who are conservatives and favor citizenship\n57 / 910 ≈ 6.3%.\nAmong each ideology, percent who favor citizenship\nConservatives: 57 / 372 ≈ 15.3%.\nModerates: 120 / 363 ≈ 33.1%.\nLiberals: 101 / 175 ≈ 57.7%.\nDo ideology and immigration views appear independent?\nNo. If independent, the percent favoring citizenship would be about the same across ideologies; the conditional percents differ widely (15%, 33%, 58%), indicating association.\n\n\n\n2.9 Question 2.30\n\nIf \\(\\dfrac{\\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{median}} = 1\\), then \\(\\bar{x}=\\mathrm{median}\\). This matches symmetric distributions.\n\nIf \\(\\dfrac{\\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{median}} &lt; 1\\), then \\(\\bar{x}&lt;\\mathrm{median}\\). This matches left-skewed distributions (lower values pull the mean down).\n\nIf \\(\\dfrac{\\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{median}} &gt; 1\\), then \\(\\bar{x}&gt;\\mathrm{median}\\). This matches right-skewed distributions (higher values pull the mean up).\n\n\n\n2.10 Question 2.34\n\nHistogram: overall shape (including bimodality) and density are apparent, while these are not visible in a box plot.\nBox plot: median, quartiles (IQR), and identification of outliers are explicit, while these are harder to read from the histogram.\nPlausibly two groups with systematically different times: men vs women.\nWomen’s finishing times are generally higher than men’s, with a larger median and typically greater spread (IQR). Men’s times are lower on average and a bit less variable.\nA downward trend over years and the changing gap between men and women. It highlights temporal patterns that a single histogram/box plot, which aggregates over time, cannot show.",
