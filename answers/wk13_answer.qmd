## Shangri-La Frontier (香格里拉·開拓異境)

Shangri-La Frontier is a cutting-edge VRMMO game. After a major update, Sunraku is testing a new build and wants to know whether it actually increases his average damage per combo compared to his old build, which had a known average of 1200 damage per combo in similar areas.

Sunraku goes to a stable grinding spot and records the damage per combo for 15 battles using the new build:

$$
1310, 1195, 1240, 1285, 1220,
1350, 1290, 1210, 1265, 1305,
1330, 1275, 1255, 1190, 1320
$$

1. Run an appropriate one-sample t-test using `t.test()`, and report a 95% confidence interval for the mean damage with the form: `95 percent confidence interval: (a, b)`.


```r
damage_sunraku <- c(
  1310, 1195, 1240, 1285, 1220,
  1350, 1290, 1210, 1265, 1305,
  1330, 1275, 1255, 1190, 1320
)

# Test if mean > 1200
t.test(
  damage_sunraku,
  mu = 1200,
  alternative = "greater",
  conf.level = 0.95
)

print(paste0("95 percent confidence interval:(",
             test_1$conf.int[1], 
             " ", 
             test_1$conf.int[2], 
             ")"
             )
      )

# (Optional) you can also run a two-sided test
t.test(
  damage_sunraku,
  mu = 1200,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  conf.level = 0.95
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false        # hide code if this is the Answers page

rm(list = ls())

damage_sunraku <- c(
  1310, 1195, 1240, 1285, 1220,
  1350, 1290, 1210, 1265, 1305,
  1330, 1275, 1255, 1190, 1320
)

# Test if mean > 1200
test_1 <- t.test(
  damage_sunraku,
  mu = 1200,
  alternative = "greater",
  conf.level = 0.95
)

test_1

print(paste0("95 percent confidence interval:(",
             test_1$conf.int[1], 
             " ", 
             test_1$conf.int[2], 
             ")"
             )
      )
```
Psyger-0 is another top-tier player in Shangri-La Frontier, known for her insane burst damage. She tests her own optimized build in the same area and logs her damage per combo in 12 battles:

$$
1380, 1425, 1405, 1360, 1390,
1435, 1410, 1375, 1440, 1400,
1395, 1420
$$

2. Does Psyger-0’s build have a different mean damage than Sunraku’s new build? Report the p-value.

```r
damage_psyger0 <- c(
  1380, 1425, 1405, 1360, 1390,
  1435, 1410, 1375, 1440, 1400,
  1395, 1420
)

# Test if their damage if different
t.test(
  damage_sunraku,
  damage_psyger0,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  conf.level = 0.95
)
```
```{r}
#| echo: false        # hide code if this is the Answers page

damage_psyger0 <- c(
  1380, 1425, 1405, 1360, 1390,
  1435, 1410, 1375, 1440, 1400,
  1395, 1420
)

# Test if their damage if different
test_2 <- t.test(
  damage_sunraku,
  damage_psyger0,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  conf.level = 0.95
)

test_2

print(test_2$p.value)
```
