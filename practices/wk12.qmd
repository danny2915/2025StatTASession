## Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto (Silent Witch 沉默魔女的祕密)

Monica is the new accountant for the Serendia Academy's student association.
She suspects that cash vs non-cash transactions in 2024 look quite different from previous years, and worries there might be some false accounting going on.

Monica sees a dataset `transactions.csv` with the following columns:

   - `year`: the year of the transaction (2015–2024)  
   - `payment_type`: `"cash"`, `"bank_transfer"`, or `"online"`  
   - `amount`: transaction amount in dollars  

She wants to use a chi-squared test to check if the distribution of payment types in 2024's accounting is significantly different from the other years.

0. Use the pipe `%>%` in the steps below.

1. Create a new column period with two categories: `pre_2024` for years `2015–2023`, 
`year_2024` for year `2024` only. Save the result as `transactions_by2024`.


2. Using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, compute a table of the number and mean of transactions for each combination of `period` and `payment_type` from `transactions_by2024`.

3. From `transactions_by2024`, create a 2 × 3 contingency table `tab` (`period` × `payment_type`) using `table()`.

4. Use chisq.test() on `tab` to test:

   - $H_0$: The distribution of `payment_type` is the same in `pre_2024` and `year_2024`.

   - $H_1$: The distribution of `payment_type` is different in `year_2024`.
   

5. Report the p-value from the chi-squared test. Is there false accounting in 2024?
