## Reminders

1. Remember to use the project and create a new script in your script folder!

2. Set the seed to be `2025`.

3. Better to use only the functions taught in the course.


## Download Data

Please download the datasets `ames.csv`

## Housing Price in 2025

1. Use `paste()` and for-loop to create a character vector `date_2025` that contains 365 days in 2025, and each date repeat 3 times. i.e., `c("2025-01-01", "2025-01-01", "2025-01-01", ..., "2025-12-31")`

::: {.callout-tip title="Hint"}
Use `if (month %in% vec)` to check if there are 28, 30 or 31 days in that month.
:::


2. Use `as.Date()` to convert the `date_2025` as type `date`.

3. Create a numeric vector `housing_price` with length 1095 having the value generated from a normal distribution with `mean = 10000`, `sd = 2000`.

4. Combine `date_2025` and `housing_price_2025` as a new dataframe `housing_2025`.

5. Use `geom_line()` with `linewidth = 0.3` to plot the average housing price for each date in 2025.
