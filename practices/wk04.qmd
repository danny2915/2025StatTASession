## Project

Remember to use the project you create last week!

## Draw Uniform Random Sample

Set random seed as 2025. Draw 200 observations from uniform distribution [0, 100] and compute the mean of the observations.

**Hint:** Use `mean()` function.

## Histogram

1. Using the random sample you just generated, create a DataFrame to store the drawn values by using `data.frame()` function, and draw the histogram graph to see the distribution.

2. Now, draw another 10,000 observations from uniform distribution [0, 100], and draw the histogram graph to see the distribution.
