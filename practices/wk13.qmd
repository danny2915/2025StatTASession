## Shangri-La Frontier (香格里拉·開拓異境)

Shangri-La Frontier is a cutting-edge VRMMO game. After a major update, Sunraku is testing a new build and wants to know whether it actually increases his average damage per combo compared to his old build, which had a known average of 1200 damage per combo in similar areas.

Sunraku goes to a stable grinding spot and records the damage per combo for 15 battles using the new build:

$$
1310, 1195, 1240, 1285, 1220,
1350, 1290, 1210, 1265, 1305,
1330, 1275, 1255, 1190, 1320
$$

1. Run an appropriate one-sample t-test using `t.test()`, and report a 95% confidence interval for the mean damage with the form: `95 percent confidence interval: (a, b)`.

Psyger-0 is another top-tier player in Shangri-La Frontier, known for her insane burst damage. She tests her own optimized build in the same area and logs her damage per combo in 12 battles:

$$
1380, 1425, 1405, 1360, 1390,
1435, 1410, 1375, 1440, 1400,
1395, 1420
$$

2. Does Psyger-0’s build have a different mean damage than Sunraku’s new build? Report the p-value.
